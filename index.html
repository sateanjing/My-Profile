		 <h2>My City</h2>
		<p>
		   I Live In Batam. As the largest city in the Riau Islands, Batam is famous as an industrial city and new transportation hub. This tropical island is also part of a free trade zone within the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Apart from the golf course which is known as one of the best in the world, Batam is also perfect for Pesona Friends who like to enjoy water sports. How come? Batam is full of sports clubs and resorts along Nongsa beach and Waterfront City. There are many activities that Pesona Friends can do there with their family. Batam is also known for its Barelang Bridge, namely six iconic bridges that connect three islands. The name is an abbreviation of these three islands: Batam, Rempang, and Galang. If calculated, the length of these six bridges reaches two kilometers. Following the Barelang bridge from start to finish only takes 20 minutes.

		<h3>Football</h3>
		<p>
			My Favourite Sport is British Football. Football is the most popular sport in England, where the first modern set of rules for the code were established in 1863, which were a major influence on the development of the modern Laws of the Game. With over 40,000 association football clubs, England has more clubs involved in the code than any other country. England hosts the world's first club, Sheffield F.C.; the world's oldest professional association football club, Notts County; the oldest national governing body, the Football Association; the joint-oldest national team; the oldest national knockout competition, the FA Cup; and the oldest national league, the English Football League. Today England's top domestic league, the Premier League, is one of the most popular and richest sports leagues in the world, with five of the ten richest football clubs in the world as of 2022.
